# QMol-grid: A MATLAB package for quantum-mechanical simulations in atomic and molecular systems

The QMol-grid package provides a suite of routines for performing quantum-mechanical simulations in atomic and molecular systems. All simulations use an underlying Cartesian-grid discretization scheme. The QMol-grid package is written using MATLAB's object-oriented features and handle classes.

The QMol-grid package provides support for the following types of computations:
- Ground-state density-functional theory `DFT`, both using a Cartesian-grid or basis-set discretization
- Ground-state Hartree Fock `HF`, both using a Cartesian-grid or basis-set discretization
- Ground-state Schrodinger equation `SE`, both using a Cartesian-grid or basis-set discretization
- Real-time time-dependent density-functional theory `TDDFT`, both using a Cartesian-grid or basis-set discretization
- Time-dependent Hartree Fock `TDHF`, for basis-set discretization only
- Time-dependent Schrodinger equation `TDSE`, both using a Cartesian-grid or basis-set discretization
