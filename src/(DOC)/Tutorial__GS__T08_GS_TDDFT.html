%% Tutorial 7: Input parameters and output variables for time-dependent density-functional theory
% The interface for defining and changing input parameters, and recovering output 
% results, in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) simulations is 
% similar to the Schrödinger equation case. Here we summarize the main features 
% of TDDFT simulations and refer to its <./TDDFT.html documentation page> for 
% more details. The documentation page also includes examples for each set of 
% observable that can be calculated on the fly while the propagation is performed.
%% 
% * External driving field: driving fields are taken in the dipole approximation 
% and the propagation can be done using the length or velocity gauge.
% * Absorbing boundaries: both complex absorbing potentials and mask functions 
% can be used as absorbers.
% * Propagators: currently, propagation is only available for grid-based models 
% (not basis-set discretization), with orders 2, 4, or 6 in time.
% * Propagation results: besides the propagation of the wave function(s), propagators 
% can calculate and save the dipole signal, energy, ionization, wave function, 
% as well as the result of a user-defined installable function. Each resulting 
% output is stored in a separate structure in the TDDFT-propagator object. Each 
% requested output can independently define its own time sampling. For field-driven 
% calculations, the exact values for the driving field used in the simulation 
% at the time each output is saved can be added to each output structure.
% * Restart file: a restart file can be generated, from which the propagation 
% can be restarted in case it gets stopped before the end of the propagation (without 
% having to start over from the beginning).
